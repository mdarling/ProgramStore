UNM’s Studio Art program offers seven different areas of concentration: painting and drawing, photography, ceramics, sculpture, printmaking, electronic arts, and environmental arts.&nbsp;</p><p>“Fine arts is a complex field from a career standpoint because the fine artist is his/her own employer and promoter. Because it may take many years to develop a career as a successful artist, most graduates initially seek ways of earning a living other than from sales of their personal work. This takes determination and perseverance with no strictly defined career path. The choices are&nbsp;very individual. This might mean a position in an arts organization or a design support positions. Some art students prepare to teach. It is not unusual for fine artists to experiment with different options for a few years” (from the University of Texas Fine Arts Career Services website).&nbsp;</p>",
