The “presentation\nskills, ability to perform in public, and control of the voice and body provide a solid basis for working effectively with others.\nTheatre also develops the ability to concentrate intensely, to listen introspectively, observe keenly, solve problems\ncreatively, think critically, develop a project collaboratively, work independently, work under pressure, meet deadlines, and\nto maintain composure when faced with the unexpected. Well-developed communication skills enable graduates to\ncontribute and to succeed in many professions” (from the University of Texas – Austin Fine Arts Career Services website).&nbsp;</p>",
