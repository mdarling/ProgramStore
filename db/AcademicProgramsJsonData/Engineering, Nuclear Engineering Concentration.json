  "program_description": "<p>Nuclear engineers are on the forefront of rapidly developing\nareas that include better, safer ways to power our planet. Theyâ€™re working on\nreactor system designs, nuclear non-proliferation, radiation interaction with\nmaterials, and reducing and controlling radioactive waste.</p>\n\n<p>The <b>Nuclear Engineering undergraduate program at the\nUniversity of New Mexico</b> gives the student broad training in the\nfundamentals of mathematics, physics, chemistry and engineering, followed by\nprofessional specialty course work involving radiation interaction with matter,\nradiation transport, radiation detection and protection, nuclear reactor theory\nand safety, thermalhydraulics and nuclear systems design. Students also select\ntechnical electives that allow them to explore in-depth areas of interest in\nnuclear engineering.</p><p>Among the exciting research areas, UNM nuclear\nengineering professors are studying what happens to the cooling system of a nuclear\nreactor under severe accident conditions. </p><p>Collaborations with national\nlaboratories focus on a variety of areas, including nuclear criticality safety,\nradiation transport, reactor theory, space nuclear power, and probabilistic\nrisk assessment.</p>\n\n<p>The program is accredited by the\nEngineering Accreditation Commission of ABET,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.abet.org/\" target=\"_Blank\">http://www.abet.org/</a>.</p>&nbsp;",
