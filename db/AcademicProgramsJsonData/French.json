  "program_description": "The M.A. in French provides an interdisciplinary foundation designed to prepare students for work in pertinent fields including secondary school teaching, translation and for entrance to doctoral programs in French. A background in French equivalent to that of an undergraduate major is required for entering candidates. M.A. candidates choose between two plans: under Plan I, they complete 24 hours of course work plus 6 hours of thesis; under Plan II, they complete 32 hours of course work without thesis. The comprehensive exams involve a more extensive written component for Plan II. Core requirements are a theory course (3 credit hours) and a professional development colloquium (1 credit hour). Students must demonstrate proficiency in another language through a four-semester sequence of course work, a proficiency examination, or proof of equivalent knowledge acquired elsewhere. Contact the graduate advisor or the department for specific information. <br>",
