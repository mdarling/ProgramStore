  "program_description": "<p>The M.A. in German Studies provides an interdisciplinary foundation designed to prepare students for work in pertinent fields including secondary school teaching, translation work, and also for entrance to doctoral programs in German. A background in German equivalent to that of an undergraduate major is required for entering candidates. M.A. candidates may choose between two plans: under Plan I, they are required to complete 24 hours of course work plus 6 thesis hours; under Plan II, they are required to complete 32 hours of course work without thesis. The comprehensive exams involve a more extensive written component for Plan II. Core requirements include a theory course (3 credit hours) and a Professional Development Colloquium (MLNG 501) (1 hour). Teaching assistants are also required to enroll in a Teaching Practicum (MLNG 500) during their first semester of teaching. M.A. candidates must demonstrate proficiency in a language other than English or German through a four-semester sequence of course work, a proficiency examination, or proof of equivalent knowledge acquired elsewhere.</p><p>Contact the graduate advisor or the department for specific information.</p>\n\n\t\t\t&nbsp;",
