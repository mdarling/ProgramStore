  "program_description": "&nbsp;Students completing the requirements and curriculum stated below will receive the Bachelor of Music Education (B.M.E.) degree and will be eligible to apply for Level 1 Licensure in Music, K–12, in the State of New Mexico.<p>Official acceptance to the degree program is granted upon admission to the College of Fine Arts as a Music Education Major (see College of Fine Arts&nbsp;<em>Admission</em>). Satisfactory completion of MUSE 194 Introduction to Music Education and MUSE 195 Introductory Teaching Practicum is necessary for official acceptance to the Music Education degree program. Students may be eligible for acceptance upon completion of two semesters; early application is advised. Students seeking only endorsement for music teacher certification must be admitted to a Teacher Education Program (see&nbsp;<em>Admission to College of Education Programs</em>). Students pursuing teacher licensure are considered de facto Music Education majors, even though their enrollment status may be non-degree, and will be required to complete all Music and Music Education course work required for the B.M.E. if this course work does not appear on their transcripts</p><p>Students will have a period of one year to remove any deficiencies revealed during the admission process. Students already enrolled at the University of New Mexico will not be eligible to transfer to the College of Fine Arts or to take 300 and 400 level professional courses until this admission process is completed. Exception will be made for students with earned baccalaureate degrees upon recommendation of the department and for students transferring from other institutions. Transfer students may be enrolled in the College of Fine Arts on a provisional basis for a maximum of two semesters, during which time they must complete the admission process.</p><p>All transfer students will be given a theory, ear-training and sight-singing proficiency examination for the purpose of determining competency in these areas. If test results reveal deficiencies, transfer students will be required to remove such by enrolling and successfully completing one or more semesters of the theory curriculum.</p><p>Students must pass the Music Education Advisory Review (MEAR) before enrolling in 300-level music education courses. The purpose of the MEAR is to assess the music education candidate’s suitability for a music teaching career. Candidates appear for an interview with music education faculty that includes evaluations of musicianship, communication skills, and personal dispositions. Prerequisites for the MEAR are 1) admission to the College of Fine Arts and 2) successful completion (grade of C or better) of MUSE 194, MUSE 195, MUS 150, and MUS 150L. For complete details, consult your advisor.</p><p>The faculty reserves the right to disqualify from further enrollment or participation in the music education program:</p><ol><li>students who fail to demonstrate reasonable progress in their professional development in music,<br><em>–or–</em></li><li>students whose conduct reveals a persistent inability to work effectively with others or an unwillingness to adhere to generally recognized standards of professional behavior,<br><em>–or–</em></li><li>students who do not consult their assigned advisor prior to registering each semester.</li></ol><p>Level 1 Licensure in Music, K–12, in New Mexico allows one to teach any music class at any level of instruction. Where two or more music educators are employed by a single school district, however, a division of responsibilities between instrumental music and vocal/general music commonly exists. The Department of Music, therefore, offers two planned programs in music education, an Instrumental Concentration and a Vocal Concentration.</p>\n\n\t\t\t<p></p>",
