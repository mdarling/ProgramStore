    "career_opportunities": "<p>&nbsp;UNM’s B.A. degree in Communication “helps to prepare students for a variety of careers including: sales, positions in organizations emphasizing internal communication, organizational training, management, human resources, or any career that involves or emphasizes communication” (from the UNM Department of Communication &amp; Journalism website). Students choose to focus on one of five areas: intercultural communication, interpersonal communication, mass communication, organizational communication, or rhetoric. &nbsp;A bachelor's degree is the minimum formal education required. Some areas may require a graduate degree, or may assist employment in highly competitive areas. Communication is a broad degree that can lead to job opportunities in many diverse fields. Therefore, it is critical that students gain related experience and skills through internships, part-time work, or volunteering in their field of interest as undergraduates.

    "career_opportunities": "<p>&nbsp;“The public is increasingly aware of geography’s relevance in an age of globalization, international instability, and accelerating environmental change. Additionally, geographic information science (GIScience) has exploded, making fundamental changes in the analytic capability of the discipline. The demand of trained geographers exceeds the supply. The Department of Geography offers a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Science degree, as well as a Master of Science degree. The BA and BS degrees prepare graduates for career paths in the broad fields of environmental science, or for entrance into the MS program. New faculty, new courses, a revitalized curriculum in our areas of emphasis make this an exciting time to be in Geography at UNM (from UNM Department of Geography brochure).” &nbsp;&nbsp;A bachelor's degree is the minimum formal education required. Master's degree qualifies you for community college teaching and advancement in industry and government. Ph.D. is required for research and teaching positions in colleges and universities and senior positions in government and industry. Some positions might require a JD. &nbsp;</p>",

After about a year of initial exploratory research, the student is generally prepared to advance to doctoral candidacy by taking and passing the Candidacy Exam (formerly Dissertation Proposal Defense), which also serves as the Comprehensive Exam in OGS rules. The faculty member who has supervised the student's initial research is the Chair of the Candidacy Exam Committee and becomes the student's dissertation supervisor upon successful completion of the exam. Please note that the student's Academic Advisor continues to advise the student on all academic matters until the student has passed the Candidacy Exam and submitted the Program of Studies.</p><p>The Candidacy Exam is an oral examination to ensure a student's readiness to enter into research and to demonstrate his/her proficiency in graduate-level physics in his/her subdiscipline.</p><ul><li>The Candidacy Exam Committee consists of four members:</li><li>A Chair, who has supervised the student's initial research and who becomes the student's dissertation supervisor upon successful completion of this exam;</li><li>Two members chosen in consultation with the Committee Chair;</li><li>A fourth \"outside\" member appointed by the Chair of the Graduate Committee.

    "program_description": "&nbsp;<p>The department admits a small number of well-qualified candidates to its Ph.D. Program each year. Successful applicants must in addition to University Requirements, submit current (within the last 3 years) GRE General Test scores, three letters of recommendation, two writing samples, and a letter of intent. The Sociology Department recommends applicants have 12 hours of advanced undergraduate sociology courses, including statistics and methods courses (or the equivalents). We also recommend college level algebra or its equivalent. In addition, such factors such as the University's commitment to affirmative action, the applicant's non-academic experience, and the ability of the department to provide faculty guidance and courses in the applicant's areas of interest are considered. Students in the M.A. Program may petition the Graduate Committee for entrance into the Ph.D. Program upon successful completion of their M.A. degree. The petition should include the thesis and three letters of recommendation from faculty members. Students who have positive reviews will then move into the Ph.D. Program.</p><p>General requirements for the Ph.D. are set forth in earlier sections of this catalog. The Ph.D. degree requires 48 hours of course work and 18 hours of dissertation. Students must also pass comprehensive examinations and write and successfully defend a dissertation.</p><p>Specific requirements for all students seeking a Ph.D. in Sociology include: SOC 500 Classical Social Theory; One of the following courses in Contemporary Theory: SOC 513 Constructing and Analyzing Contemporary Sociological Theory (Contemporary Social Theory I); OR SOC 514 20th Century European Theory (Contemporary Social Theory II); SOC 523 Proseminar (students should take this course as early in their careers as possible); Sociology 580 Methods of Social Research; SOC 581 Advanced Social Statistics I; SOC 582 Advanced Social Statistics II; and another quantitative or qualitative methods course approved by the Graduate Advisor; 18 units of SOC 699 Dissertation; passing all required courses with at least a grade of B-; Comprehensive Examinations (written and oral); a Ph.D. dissertation and passing the Final Examination for Doctorate. Prior to taking the comprehensive examinations, a Committee of Studies must be appointed which consists of at least three University of New Mexico faculty members approved for graduate instruction. The chairperson must be a regular faculty member approved by the student's graduate unit. A doctoral student must apply for and be admitted to doctoral candidacy after completing all course work and passing the comprehensive examination. The Dissertation Committee will consist of at least four members approved for graduate instruction: two members must hold regular, full-time faculty appointments at the University of New Mexico; one member must be from the student's graduate unit; the dissertation chairperson must be a regular (tenured or tenure-track), full-time member of the University of New Mexico faculty; a required external member must hold a regular full-time appointment outside the student's unit/department at the University of New Mexico. This member may be from the University of New Mexico or from another accredited institution; one member may be a non-faculty expert in the student's major research area. Doctoral candidates must be enrolled during the semester in which they complete degree requirements, including the summer session.</p><hr><br>",

Biomedical\nengineering, the designing of materials and instruments for therapy and diagnosis, has roots in Biochemistry. Much of the\nwork of the director of a clinical laboratory is biochemical. Recombinant DNA research and monoclonal antibody\nproduction provide new diagnostic tools, new therapies, new ways to fight pests, improve agriculture, and clean the\nenvironment. Pharmaceutical companies need biochemists to design and evaluate new drugs. The Biochemistry major is\nan excellent preparation for professional training in medicine, dentistry, clinical nutrition, public health, and veterinary\nmedicine.

    "program_description": "&nbsp;\n\t\t\n\t<p>The Program in Comparative Literature and Cultural Studies offers an interdisciplinary B.A., a B.A. second major and minor, and both an M.A. and a graduate minor. Students define their own field of study as they complete core courses in cultural and literary studies and critical theory offered by participating departments and programs across the university.</p><p>How do language, literature, film and other media operate? What allows us to understand (or misunderstand) meaning? Where do stories come from and what purposes do they serve? How do racial, sexual, national and class identities come to seem \"normal\"? What happens when different cultural traditions collide or collaborate? Are we born or do we become women or men? Where does taste come from? Does the medium in which an idea is expressed matter? Is literature merely a reflection of society or is it an agent of change? The Program in Comparative Literature and Cultural Studies provides students with a framework for responding to these kinds of questions.</p><p>Students in the program have defined a wide variety of fields of study, including, images of motherhood in Greek tragedy, the migration of Flamenco to New Mexico, theories of monsters, sites of Memory in Haitian women's writing, postmodernity in Chinese architecture, environmental justice and the silicon chip industry, and the cultural politics of the debate on capital punishment.</p><p>Both the undergraduate and graduate programs offer students an exceptional opportunity to devise their own program of study and to work in close collaboration with faculty advisors. B.A. students may choose from two concentrations, the cultural studies concentration and the comparative literature concentration. M.A. students may choose a concentration in cultural studies, comparative literature or classics.</p><h3>The Comparative Literature Concentration</h3><p>Comparative Literature asks that we look at the intersections of cultural traditions as well as the forces that create a sense of their difference. Comparatists generally work in two or more languages and have a knowledge of the literature, film, visual art and other media produced in a particular period by multiple cultures. Comparatists are frequently concerned with theoretical questions about how meaning works and how texts are constructed and have an effect on readers or viewers. Increasingly, comparatists have focused on how to approach the study of world literature. B.A. and M.A. students choosing the comparative literature concentration divide their course work beyond core requirements evenly between literatures written in two different languages or cultural works associated with two different linguistic traditions.</p><h3>The Cultural Studies Concentration</h3><p>Cultural Studies asks that we look at the relationships of power that are developed, registered and disseminated by literary and cultural works. Scholars and students working in cultural studies are often as interested in popular texts (magazine articles, blogs, billboards, video performances . . .) as they are in elite culture. Increasingly, cultural studies has become associated with set of analytic moves for approaching questions of race, gender, sex, class, nation and the transnational. B.A. and M.A. students choosing the cultural studies concentration divide their course work beyond core requirements evenly between the study of theories and approaches to culture, on the one hand, and study of a field of their own, which they identify in consultation with their advisor (and committee members).</p><br>",

    "program_description": "<p>The B.S. in Environmental Science synthesizes quantitative studies of the interactions between the solid earth, oceans, atmosphere and biological processes taking place therein. The degree provides scientific training for environment-related occupations, including environmental sciences per se as well as peripheral fields such as Law and Medicine. Environmental Science covers a vast sweep of applied Earth science. Students, therefore, have considerable flexibility in tailoring the major to their individual interests while pursuing a common core of supporting math and science. By taking courses from four out of seven subdisciplinary groups, a wide variety of approaches to environmental science can be accommodated, including preparation for graduate study in the subdisciplines. Students pursuing this degree are strongly encouraged to consult the Environmental Science undergraduate advisor in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at an early stage in their program in order to design their curriculum in the disciplinary groups. All majors are encouraged to pursue an undergraduate thesis (493 and 495) in collaboration with a faculty advisor.</p><p><strong>Required Environmental Science Core Courses:</strong><br>ENVS 101 or EPS 101, ENVS 102L or EPS 105L, ENVS 330, ENVS 430, EPS 428 or 433 or STAT 345 or higher, and EPS 490.</p><p>At least 6 credits each from four of the following seven groups (of which no more than 4 credits may be below 300), plus additional credits from Earth &amp; Planetary Sciences above 300 (excluding 491-492, 493 and 495) for a total of 30 credits:</p><ol><li>Spatial analysis: EPS 455L; GEOG 381L, 487L, 488L</li><li>Geochemistry: EPS 203, 407L, 410, 415, CE 437L</li><li>Geoscience: EPS 201L, 301, 302L, 310L, 333</li><li>Earth Surface Processes: EPS 304L, 333, 481L, 485L</li><li>Hydroscience: EPS 462 or CE 441, EPS 443, 476</li><li>Climate: EPS&nbsp;352, 436, 437, 439</li><li>Ecology: BIOL 203L, 310L, 405, 451, 461L, 463L, 475, 494, 495, 496L</li></ol><p>Supporting Science required courses:<br>MATH 162, 163; BIOL 123/124L or higher; CHEM 121 and 123L; PHYC 160.</p><p>Students can satisfy the requirements for a distributed minor completing CHEM 122 and 124L, PHYC 161, and 7 additional hours from Chemistry (above 122 and 124L), MATH (above 163), Physics (above 161), Biology above 124L (not including courses counted in the Ecology subdisciplinary group) or Astronomy 270 or above or, with permission, from selected Anthropology, Engineering or Geography courses.</p><p>A student may also choose to complete a minor outside of the EPS Department. Six credits from courses in subdisciplinary group (g), all of which require additional Biology courses as prerequisites, will satisfy the requirements for a Minor in Biology (if taken separately from requirements for the B.S. in Environmental Science).</p>\n\n\t\t\t&nbsp;",

Founded in 2004, the HPR program was granted NCPE membership in 2005.</p><h2>Program History</h2><p>The need to educate a future generation of professionals capable of conserving New Mexico’s, the nation’s, and the world’s outstanding cultural heritage while creating new regionally-responsive design led to the creation of the School of Architecture and Planning's Graduate Certificate Program in Historic Preservation and Regionalism (HPR). While the school has long offered individual courses in historic preservation, and regional design and planning, demand for a coordinated program of courses increased in the 1990's.</p><p>In 1999, as a result of this demand, and a bequest from the legendary and recently-deceased cultural landscape historian J. B. Jackson, the School hired Chris Wilson to bring more regional history and cultural content into its curriculum. He was also charged with strengthening the School’s connections with New Mexico’s communities. Professor Wilson brought over fifteen years experience as a cultural historian, author, writer, preservation consultant, and adjunct professor to the task. His long-term friendship with J. B. Jackson; his expertise in Southwest historic resources, and graduate education; and extensive ties to communities, non-profit organizations, and government agencies across New Mexico informed the development of the program. Wilson interviewed a wide range of government and non-profit architects, planners, and landscape architects; government, non-profit and tribal officials, and tourism professionals who suggested a program not only in historic preservation, but also in contemporary regionally-appropriate architecture and planning. Many felt that a graduate certificate program was needed, not just in preservation but in contemporary design and planning as well.</p><p>From 2000 to 2004, Wilson raised significant funds from the state legislature, foundations, individual donors and from within the University to develop a new certificate program, establish a program endowment, and develop six new courses. Distinguished professionals developing courses in the areas of expertise included architect José Zelaya, preservationist Elmo Baca, architect Edith Cherry, and planner Arnold Valdez. After extensive review at the University and state level, the Graduate Certificate in Historic Preservation and Regionalism received formal approval in the spring of 2004.</p>",

    "program_description": "&nbsp;<p>Cities, towns and regional landscapes are among humanity’s largest and most complex achievements. The buildings, public works, plazas and parks of even a small town embody substantial amounts of capital, energy, natural resources, history and aspirations. Cities are among our greatest creations, yet typically no single individual creates them. Rather they arise from the dialog between multiple designers, clients, regulators, critics and users. Sometimes the cities and towns that emerge are sublime places. Frequently they have only fragments of greatness or are soul-deadening and environmentally unhealthy.</p><p>The Certificate in Urban and Regional Design aims to give students the foundations to ask critical questions about, study examples of, and propose approaches to designing the emergence of regions, towns, and cities.</p><ul><li><p>What does it take to create a great place that in and of itself gives life dignity, joy and beauty?</p></li><li><p>What tools are available to help compose places made by multiple designers?</p></li><li><p>How can design inform regulation?</p></li></ul><p>New Mexico offers a unique variety of settlement and district types for study, including Native American pueblos; strip mall development; Spanish Colonial settlements; streetcar suburbs; gated residential developments; acequia villages; railroad, company, courthouse square, military and Mormon towns; second home sprawl; ghost mining towns; Interstate commercial clusters, colonias; and communes. Ruins of Anasazi cities, myths of lost cities, and a rich literature of place provide further opportunities for research. Interactions between the natural and built environment are particularly vivid and strong in New Mexico’s desert and alpine ecosystems. Examples of both extractive settlements and centuries-old renewable resource based settlements are clearly represented in the State and region.</p><p>Questions about the program should be directed to Mark C.

In this program, a student can earn degrees in law and public administration in about four years. In the first year, the student enrolls in the School of Public Administration (SPA) and completes one year in the program. In the second year, the student enrolls in the School of Law and takes first-year law courses. In the third and fourth years, the student takes selected law and public administration electives. The student must gain the consent of both the Law School Dean and the Public Administration Director in choosing courses for any semester. The law school accepts six hours of public administration credits toward its degree requirements, and the SPA accepts six hours of law credit toward the MPA degree requirements.&nbsp;<strong>It is important to note that the applicant must be admitted to both the Law School and the School of Public Administration</strong>.</p><p><strong>MPA/MCRP Degree Program</strong><br>The Master of Public Administration (MPA) and Master of Community and Regional Planning (MCRP) dual degree addresses the needs of students who desire public, private or non-profit careers in leadership positions requiring professional skill in community and regional planning and public administration. The program enables students to develop key knowledge and experience necessary to assess public needs, determine public goals and objectives, develop community-based strategies, and manage and resolve public disputes. Students admitted to the dual degree program typically aim to become administrators and/or managers in planning projects or programs working with local citizens, special districts, and local, state and federal public agencies. Graduates also work in a variety of consulting situations with community-based for-profit and non-profit clients. Students may earn the MPA/MCRP degree in 61 hours, approximately two-thirds the time it would normally take to earn both degrees separately (92 credit hours are required separately - 50 in CRP and 42 in PADM).&nbsp;<a href=\"http://spa.unm.edu/common/documents/spa-crp-checklist.pdf\">SPA CRP Dual Degree Program Checklist</a></p>",

GRE scores (verbal/ analytical/quantitative) and three letters of recommendation also are required as part of the application which will be reviewed by the department’s Graduate Studies Committee. Acceptance into the program will depend upon: the number of openings available for new graduate students; the applicant’s potential as indicated by the materials submitted with the application; and agreement by an appropriate faculty person to act as advisor to the student. No student will be accepted into the program unless he or she can be placed under the direction of a faculty advisor who will help to plan the student’s program. Students admitted to the program may change their advisor, subject to prior approval by the new advisor. Students are admitted to a specific area of concentration and must petition the appropriate concentration faculty for acceptance into another concentration. Continuation in the program will require progress at a rate deemed satisfactory by the appropriate concentration faculty, which will review progress each year.</p><p>Within the anthropology graduate program, there are both general departmental requirements and requirements specific to a student’s concentration. The student must consult with the appropriate graduate advisor for information on concentration requirements before registering.

Ultimately, most phenomena in biology, medicine, geology, and the environmental sciences can be described in terms of the chemical and physical behavior of atoms and molecules. Because of the wide appeal and utility of chemistry, UNM offers many lower-division courses, differing in emphasis and style, which meet diverse needs. The curriculum in chemistry exposes the student to the principal areas of modern chemistry, including organic, inorganic, biochemistry, and physical chemistry. The curriculum is designed to meet the needs of students who plan to end their formal education with a bachelor of arts or bachelor of science degree as well as those who wish to go on for an advanced degree.</p><p>It is the goal of the undergraduate chemistry program to encourage students to become active members within the departmental academic community. Interaction between undergraduates, faculty, and graduate students is strongly promoted through class and laboratory contact.

    "program_description": "&nbsp;The undergraduate program in chemistry at UNM aims to provide rigorous education in the fundamental areas of chemical knowledge and chemical experimentation. The program is extremely flexible in its electives to provide an excellent preparation for careers in many different areas of chemistry and chemical biology. Our chemistry undergraduate program is designed to provide an education based on science both for students planning to go on to graduate study, and for those intending to immediately pursue professional careers in chemistry or an allied field in which sound knowledge of chemistry is important.<p>Chemistry occupies a key position in the modern sciences. Ultimately, most phenomena in biology, medicine, geology, and the environmental sciences can be described in terms of the chemical and physical behavior of atoms and molecules. Because of the wide appeal and utility of chemistry, UNM offers many lower-division courses, differing in emphasis and style, which meet diverse needs. The curriculum in chemistry exposes the student to the principal areas of modern chemistry, including organic, inorganic, biochemistry, and physical chemistry. The curriculum is designed to meet the needs of students who plan to end their formal education with a bachelor of arts or bachelor of science degree as well as those who wish to go on for an advanced degree.</p><p>It is the goal of the undergraduate chemistry program to encourage students to become active members within the departmental academic community. Interaction between undergraduates, faculty, and graduate students is strongly promoted through class and laboratory contact. Through the offering of small classes, students are provided with exciting opportunities to pursue undergraduate research projects under the direction of a faculty mentor. The department strives to provide its students with a friendly, stimulating, and rigorous learning environment.</p>",

    "program_description": "&nbsp;Most graduate students enroll in this program. While at least 18 credit hours of formal lecture courses at the 500 level are required for the degree, the central focus is on research. This effort culminates in the preparation and defense of a dissertation describing an original contribution to the field of chemistry. Intensive training in research prepares Ph.D. candidates for a career in university teaching and research, industrial or governmental research, or college teaching.<p>The Ph.D. preliminary examination includes two components: cumulative examinations and the oral defense of a research proposal. The cumulative examinations are used to ensure that each student develops adequate depth of knowledge in one or more of the broad areas of chemistry: analytical, biological/biophysical, inorganic, organic, physical. These examinations are given eight times each academic year. A student must pass five of the examinations within sixteen attempts in order to be admitted to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. The cumulative examinations generally emphasize a knowledge of chemistry fundamentals and familiarity with the current literature.</p><p>During the student's fourth semester in the program, he or she is expected to prepare, present, and defend a proposal that defines the goals, rationale, and methodology of the anticipated research. The research proposal is presented in seminar form and is then defended orally before the student's Committee-on-Studies. This defense provides the oral examination traditionally required for admission to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. After admission to candidacy, the student completes the dissertation research and writes the dissertation under the supervision of the research advisor. The final examination for the Ph.D. is an oral defense of the dissertation.</p><p>The time required to complete all requirements for the Ph.D. degree depends on the student's preparation prior to entering the program and on his or her drive and perseverance in following through a research plan.

Students define their own field of study as they complete core courses in cultural and literary studies and critical theory offered by participating departments and programs across the university.</p><h3>Potential Fields of Study and Inquiry</h3><p>Students in the program have defined a wide variety of fields of study, including, images of motherhood in Greek tragedy, the migration of Flamenco to New Mexico, theories of monsters, sites of Memory in Haitian women's writing, postmodernity in Chinese architecture, environmental justice and the silicon chip industry, and the cultural politics of the debate on capital punishment.</p><p>Possible academic trajectories may be: How do language, literature, film and other media operate? What allows us to understand (or misunderstand) meaning? Where do stories come from and what purposes do they serve? How do racial, sexual, national and class identities come to seem \"normal\"? What happens when different cultural traditions collide or collaborate? Are we born or do we become women or men? Where does taste come from? Does the medium in which an idea is expressed matter? Is literature merely a reflection of society or is it an agent of change? The Program in Comparative Literature and Cultural Studies provides students with a framework for responding to these kinds of questions.</p><p>Both the undergraduate and graduate programs offer students an exceptional opportunity to devise their own program of study and to work in close collaboration with faculty advisors. B.A. students may choose from two concentrations, the cultural studies concentration and the comparative literature concentration. M.A. students may choose a concentration in cultural studies, comparative literature or classics.</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.unm.edu/~fll/pdfs/grad_clcs_checklist.pdf\">Graduate Checklist for CL/CS</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.unm.edu/~fll/pdfs/clcs_program_req.pdf\">CL/CS Program Description &amp; Requirements</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.unm.edu/~fll/pdfs/clcs_phd_links.pdf\">Resource Links to CL/CS Ph.D. Programs at Other Institutions</a></li></ul><h4>Introduction to Graduate Study in Comparative Literature Criticism and Theory</h4><p>This course is required for all CL/CS graduate students and provides an introduction to tools used regularly in the fields of comparative literature and cultural studies for analyzing literary and cultural texts. It introduces influential movements in theory (including structuralism, psychoanalysis, Marxist criticism, deconstruction, cultural studies, postcolonial studies, gender and sexuality theory) by looking at their practitioners and their critical filiations. Our focus will be on learning how to ask the questions that these movements have used productively to analyze culture, as well as on identifying an argument's limits.</p><h3>The M.A. Program</h3><p>The M.A. Program is recognized as a strong bridge program for students wishing to prepare themselves for an outstanding doctoral program in Film Studies, Cultural Studies, Comparative Literature and Classics. Students hone their writing, their analytic ability their theoretical acumen, their awareness of literary and cultural movements, and their foreign or classical language skills through interdisciplinary course work, intensive study for comprehensive exams, and by taking advantage of the option to write a thesis.</p><h4>The Comparative Literature Concentration</h4><p>Comparative Literature inquires about the intersections of cultural traditions as well as the forces that create a sense of their difference. Comparatists generally work in two or more languages and have a knowledge of the literature, film, visual art and other media produced in a particular period by multiple cultures. They are frequently concerned with theoretical questions about how meaning works and how texts are constructed and have an effect on readers or viewers.</p><p>Increasingly, comparatists have focused on how to approach the study of world literature. B.A. and M.A. students choosing the comparative literature concentration divide their course work beyond core requirements evenly between literatures written in two different languages or cultural works associated with two different linguistic traditions.</p><h4>The Cultural Studies Concentration</h4><p>Cultural Studies inquires about the relationships of power and/or meaning that are developed, registered and disseminated by literary and cultural works. Scholars and students working in cultural studies are often as interested in popular texts (magazine articles, blogs, billboards, video performances . . .) as they are in elite culture. Increasingly, cultural studies has become associated with set of analytic moves for approaching questions of race, gender, sex, class, nation and the transnational. B.A. and M.A. students choosing the cultural studies concentration divide their course work beyond core requirements evenly between the study of theories and approaches to culture, on the one hand, and study of a field of their own, which they identify in consultation with their advisor (and committee members).</p><h4><a href=\"http://www.unm.edu/~fll/grad_classics.html\">The Classics Concentration</a></h4><p>(M.A. only -- Classics exists as a separate major on the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.unm.edu/~fll/ug_classics.html\">B.A. level</a>): Classics demands a rigorous knowledge of Classical languages and exposure to the history and cultural concerns of the Ancient World. M.A. students in the concentration divide their course work between advanced language study and courses focusing on the history, art, literature, culture and archaeology of the Ancient world.</p>\n\n\t\t\t&nbsp;",

    "program_description": "&nbsp;\n\t\t\n\t<p>The Department of Earth &amp; Planetary Sciences offers the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees. In addition to the application form and fee and official transcripts for all college study required by the Office of Admissions, the Department requires a Departmental application, three letters of recommendation, a letter of intent, unofficial transcript copies, and general GRE scores for admission consideration. Application instructions and forms for admission, financial aid, and letters of recommendation are available from the Department of Earth &amp; Planetary Sciences via our Web site:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://epswww.unm.edu/\">http://epswww.unm.edu</a>.</p><p>Entering graduate students must demonstrate via their transcripts that they have received rigorous scientific preparation in courses relevant to graduate study in earth, planetary, atmospheric, or environmental science. Because the E&amp;PS Department offers graduate training in many aspects of the earth sciences, there is no single list of courses that must have been completed prior to graduate study. Necessary background courses must instead be mutually agreed upon by the student, thesis advisor, and thesis committee, and must be approved by the Graduate Committee. It is expected that some students will need to take one or more 300-level EPS courses in order to prepare them adequately for their graduate programs; such courses must be taken as early in those students’ programs as possible. No graduate credit can be earned for 300-level classes in E&amp;PS. Entering graduate students are expected to have completed the equivalent of Math 162 and 163, Chemistry 121 and 123L and 122 and 124L, and Physics 160 and 161 (calculus I and II, general chemistry I and II, and calculus-based physics that includes mechanics, electricity, heat, and magnetism). If one or more of these courses has not been taken, it will be formally identified as a deficiency that must be made up within the student’s first year in the graduate program. Additional coursework in math, chemistry, physics, statistics, or biology is encouraged. No graduate credit can be earned for 100- or 200-level math and science classes.</p><p>Students with a B.S. degree are generally admitted into the M.S. program. Under certain circumstances direct admission to the Ph.D. program from a B.S. degree may be possible. General requirements for the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees are stated in the earlier pages of this catalog. Each candidate will meet with their advisor, during the first week or so of the first semester of enrollment. The results of this interview will determine in part the student’s ensuing schedule. M.S. candidates are required to pass an examination involving the preparation and defense of a thesis proposal during the second semester of enrollment. Ph.D. candidates are required to pass a Comprehensive Examination, during the third semester of post-M.S. enrollment, involving the preparation and defense of two dissertation proposals.</p>",

    "career_opportunities": "<p>&nbsp;Economics is the social science that studies the production, distribution, and consumption of wealth, goods and services. Economics explains how people interact within markets to get what they want or accomplish certain goals. Since economics is a driving force of human interaction, studying it often reveals why people and governments behave in particular ways. In short, economics includes the study of labor, land, and investments, of money, income, and production, and of taxes and government expenditures. Economists&nbsp;seek&nbsp;to measure well-­‐being, to learn how well-­‐being may increase overtime, and to evaluate the well-­‐being of the rich and the poor. Although the behavior of individuals is important, economics also addresses the collective behavior of businesses and industries, governments and countries, and the globe as a whole. Microeconomics starts by thinking about how individuals make decisions. Macroeconomics considers aggregate outcomes. The two points of view are essential in understanding most economic phenomena. Some of the areas of specialization within economics include labor markets, industrial organization, urban systems, mathematical economics, international trade and finance, history of economic thought, monetary systems, public finance, econometrics, and comparative economic systems. &nbsp;A bachelor's degree is the minimum formal education required. However, many employers also require graduate school. For example, they may require a master's degree, and some require a Ph.D., M.D., or J.D. (law degree).&nbsp;</p>",

    "program_description": "&nbsp;\n\t\t\n\t<h3>M.A. Concentration in Language and Literature (32 hours)</h3><p>The Master of Arts, Concentration in Language and Literature, emphasizes research and writing, innovation and tradition, in order to promote well-rounded scholars in British, Irish, and American literature; literary history, criticism, and theory; and language theory. The combination of coursework and the multi-optioned portfolio enables M.A. students in Language and Literature to develop areas of special emphasis, while ensuring a broad understanding of a variety of historical fields. Applicants should already possess a Bachelor’s degree in English or a closely related discipline.</p><p>The degree requires 32 hours of coursework; competency in a language other than English; and a portfolio (ENGL 596). All students work under Plan II (no thesis), as described below.</p><p>The 32 hours of coursework are distributed across core and distribution requirements as follows. Nine hours of core requirements: Introduction to the Professional Study of English (ENGL 500); Pedagogy (ENGL 537, 538, 539 or 592); and Theory (ENGL 510, 511, 610 or 541 when taught from a theoretical perspective). Twenty hours of area electives, with at least one course from each of four areas: 1) the Middle Ages, 2) the Early Modern/Contact Period, 3) the Long Nineteenth Century, and 4) Modern and Contemporary. Three hours of Portfolio (ENGL 596). In completing these course requirements, students must take at least two four-hour seminars. Students must form a Committee on Studies (COS) at the beginning of their second semester; the COS advises the students on course selection and on portfolio preparation. First semester MA in Language and Literature students should consult with the Associate Chair of Graduate Studies for advisement on course selection and the appointment of the COS.</p><p>In the semester before graduation, students begin preparing a portfolio of work under the direction of their COS. In the semester of graduation, students enroll in ENGL 596, “Portfolio,” for 3 hours. In addition to the essays and other works, the portfolio must include a ten- to fifteen-page preface situating the portfolio selections in a critical, theoretical, historical, or professional context. Students will defend their portfolio before the COS no later than the end of the tenth week of the final semester.</p><hr><h3>M.A. Concentration in Medieval Studies</h3><p>The M.A. concentration in Medieval Studies is designed for students who wish to pursue an interdisciplinary Master’s degree in medieval English literature. The course of study offers a multicultural and interdisciplinary foundation for the study of the Middle Ages and hence would appeal to students who wish to continue their studies in the medieval period above the B.A. level. It will also appeal to secondary school teachers who are seeking a multi-disciplinary content-intensive M.A. degree. Finally, the M.A. concentration prepares the student for the Ph.D. Concentration in Medieval Studies.</p><p>This concentration requires 34 hours of interdisciplinary course work, of which 22 hours must be in English. See the department’s Web site and Graduate Studies Handbook for specific policy and procedures.</p><hr><h3>M.A. Concentration in Rhetoric and Writing (32 hours)</h3><p><strong>Optional emphases in Teaching and Professional Writing</strong></p><p>A Master of Arts in English with Concentration in Rhetoric and Writing prepares graduates for careers in professional writing and post-secondary teaching. Students interested in teaching study pedagogical theories and develop practical applications in traditional classrooms and in online or tutoring venues. Students interested in professional writing enroll in writing workshops, where they strengthen existing abilities and sharpen technical expertise in a variety of genres; internship placements in workplace professional writing venues are optional.</p><p>This degree requires 32 hours of coursework; competency in a foreign language or approved research skill; and a portfolio (ENGL 596). Students may choose emphasis in writing or teaching; all students work under Plan II (no thesis).</p><p>9 hours of core required courses: 542 and 543; 537 or 538 or 539.</p><p>10 hours of coursework, including one 4-hour seminar, chosen from at least two of the groups A-E listed in the English Department Graduate Studies Handbook.</p><p>12 hours of general electives: Four courses from among 538-545, 513-520, 587, or other courses in English as approved by the Committee on Studies (COS) and the Associate Chair of Graduate Studies; students may offer up to 6 hours of courses from departments outside of English as electives as approved by their COS and the Graduate Director; students may offer up to 6 hours of ENGL 597 (Problems) for work related to teacher training or professional writing experience, as approved by their COS and the Associate Chair of Graduate Studies.</p><p>1 hour of Master's Portfolio, ENGL 596: In the semester before graduation, students prepare a portfolio of work under the direction of their COS which is presented for evaluation in the ninth week of the student’s final semester of attendance.</p><p><strong>Emphasis in Teaching (12 hours)</strong><br>Teaching Emphasis students take 537 or 538 or 539 (depending on what they take for the Core Requirement above) plus 9 hours in other pedagogy-based courses offered in English, the College of Education, or other departments as approved by their COS and the Associate Chair of Graduate Studies; up to 6 hours may be offered as Teaching Practicum (ENGL 597, Problems).</p><p><strong>Emphasis in Professional Writing (12 hours)</strong><br>Professional Writing Emphasis students must take 539, either in the Core Requirement or as an elective, plus 9 or 12 hours (depending on where they count 539) from 513-520, 587. Professional Writing Emphasis students may take up to 6 hours of courses in other departments as approved by their COS and the Associate Chair of Graduate Studies; up to 6 hours may be offered as Professional Writing Internship (ENGL 598, Internship, CR/NC) as approved by their COS and the Associate Chair of Graduate Studies.</p>",

    "career_opportunities": "<p>&nbsp;“Besides teaching and literary research, a major in English can lead to professional careers in archival and curatorial librarianship, publishing, journalism, advertising and the arts; as well as human resources, sales and marketing, management, and government work. Even when additional qualifications are needed, as in law, an undergraduate major in English is often a distinct advantage” (from UNM Course Catalog). UNM’s English department offers five different areas of concentration: liberal arts, pre-graduate, professional writing, pre-law, and creative writing. It also offers a major in English-Philosophy. &nbsp;A bachelor's degree is the minimum formal education required. Some areas may require a graduate degree, or may assist employment in highly competitive areas. English is a broad degree that can lead to job opportunities in many diverse fields. .&nbsp;</p>",

The course of study differs from the typical Ph.D. in Medieval English Literature in that it involves diverse departments and presents exciting and provocative points of intersection between literatures and cultures of the Middle Ages and later periods. See the department’s Web site and Graduate Studies Handbook for specific policy and procedures.</p>",

Even when additional qualifications are needed, as in law, an undergraduate major in English is often a distinct advantage” (from UNM Course Catalog). UNM’s English department offers five different areas of concentration: liberal arts, pre-graduate, professional&nbsp;writing, pre-law, and creative writing. It also offers a major in English-Philosophy. &nbsp;A bachelor's degree is the minimum formal education required. Some areas may require a graduate degree, or may assist employment in highly competitive areas. English is a broad degree that can lead to job opportunities in many diverse fields.&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>",

While the entire application is considered, and no precise GPA cutoff is used, competitive applicants generally have at least a B average (3.0 in a 4.0 system) in previous academic work. GRE scores (general test) are also evaluated as part of the application procedure. Applicants are also asked to submit a letter of intent, three letters of recommendation and two writing samples.</p><p>We recommend that entering graduate student have had 12 hours of advanced undergraduate sociology courses, especially including satisfactory performance in sociological research methods and theory. We also recommend college level algebra or its equivalent. A graduate student admitted with deficiencies in any of these may be required to satisfactorily complete (with a grade of at least B, 3.0) the appropriate undergraduate course work. Credit hours earned in courses taken to remove such deficiencies do not apply to the minimum hours required for a master's degree.</p><p>The M.A. degree requires 24 hours of course work, 6 hours of thesis, a written thesis and passing the Final examination for the Thesis. Students need to maintain a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0, and all required courses must be completed with a grade of at least B-. After completing 12 hours of course work, and in consultation with the major advisor, students must file a Program of Studies with the Office of Graduate Studies. Before writing a thesis, students must appoint a thesis committee consisting of a chairperson and at least two additional faculty members. At least two of the committee members must hold regular full-time faculty appointments at The University of New Mexico.</p><p>Core course requirements for all students seeking a master's degree in sociology consist of (i) Three hours of graduate sociological theory (either Sociology 500, 513, or 514); (ii) A one hour graduate proseminar (Sociology 523) to be taken as soon as possible; (iii) Methods of Social Research I (Sociology 580); (iv) Advanced Social Statistics I (Sociology 581); and (v) at least 12 hours of substantive courses in the social sciences, as approved by the Department's Graduate Committee.</p><p>In addition to these 22 core hours, M.A. students must complete at least 8 more hours of course work, which includes 6 hours of thesis credit (Sociology 599).&nbsp; Once a student enrolls in Sociology 599 she or he must stay continuously enrolled in at least one thesis hour for each semester until all degree requirements are completed.</p>",

    "program_description": "The Ph.D. in Spanish and Portuguese at the University of New Mexico requires a minimum of 36 hours of graduate courses (not including dissertation hours).&nbsp; The degree consists of a departmental concentration and twelve additional hours in a supporting field.&nbsp; All Ph.D. coursework in Spanish must be at the 500- or 600-level, with the exception of SPAN 438 - Mexican Literature, and SPAN 423 - Cervantes’ Quijote.<br><br>1. Departmental Concentration:&nbsp;The two concentrations are Literature and Linguistics.&nbsp;<br>The concentration in Literature consists 24 credit hours of a group of courses in a genre (narrative, poetry, theater) and a period (Medieval, Renaissance/Golden Age/Colonial, 18th and 19th Centuries, 20th Century) and 12 hours in a supporting field.&nbsp;<br>The concentration in Linguistics requires 36 hours of a range of courses from the various subfields of linguistics offered at UNM.&nbsp;<br><br>2. Required Courses:<br>For the Linguistic concentration either SPAN 542 - History of the Spanish Language or PORT 561 - History of the Portuguese Language and PORT 461 - Graduate Portuguese Reading.&nbsp;<br>For the Literature concentration SPAN 601 (Literary Theory) and six units of Portuguese 400 level or above are required.&nbsp; These required courses may count toward the 36 hours of coursework.<br><br>3. Language Requirement:<br>Research at the graduate and professional levels is enhanced by the mastery of several languages.&nbsp; Students are advised to consider their professional goals in selecting a language to fulfill the department’s requirement. The Portuguese language, as well as Brazilian literature and culture, share many similarities with the Spanish language and Spanish American literature and culture.&nbsp; Coursework in Portuguese is strongly encouraged by the Department of Spanish and Portuguese as it will enhance students’ understanding and appreciation of such similarities.&nbsp; Portuguese 277 is recommended.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All Ph.D. candidates must demonstrate proficiency equivalent to two years of university-level study in a language apart from English and the student’s language of major study.&nbsp; This proficiency is normally demonstrated by completing, in consultation with the Departmental Graduate Advisor, a fourth-semester or above numbered language course with a grade of B or better.&nbsp; Alternately, the student may complete the requirement by demonstrating proficiency equivalent to one year of university-level study in two foreign languages, by completing second-semester or above numbered language courses in both languages with a grade of B or better.&nbsp; This requirement can be met through coursework done as part of the B.A. and/or M.A.<br><br>4. Comprehensive Examination:<br>The doctoral examination encompasses both the concentration and the additional 12 hours in a supporting field.&nbsp; The Student will compile a reading list in consultation with his or her Chair of Committee on Studies.&nbsp;<br>The examination consists of three parts:<br>a. A 72-hour written examination covering areas of the concentration as well as the supporting field.<br>b. An assigned research essay in the student’s concentration.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The research question is developed in collaboration with the Committee on Studies and is generally geared&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to prepare the student to work on the projected dissertation topic.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The student will have two weeks to complete the essay.<br>c. A comprehensive oral examination to be scheduled two weeks after the conclusion of the written<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; examination.<br><br>5. Ph.D. Dissertation:<br>Consult the information and requirements specified in the University of New Mexico Catalog.&nbsp; A dissertation proposal will be presented to and approved by the Dissertation Committee in the semester following the comprehensive examination.&nbsp; An approved copy of the dissertation proposal must be turned in to the Graduate Advisor. <br>",

The program provides a firm grounding in both western and non-western art history within the context of a liberal arts education. Undergraduate work covers the broad range of art history while graduate work leading to both the M.A. and the Ph.D. degrees is organized into two major fields of specialization: Arts of the Americas and Art of the Modern Age. The curriculum in each area of concentration is nationally and internationally recognized.</p><p>Arts of the Americas brings together the arts of pre- and post-contact cultures of North, Central, and South America. Integral fields of specialization include Mesoamerican and South American art and architecture, ancient and modern Native American arts, Spanish Colonial art and architecture, and nineteenth and twentieth century Latin American arts. Along with the study of acknowledged discontinuities in form and series brought about with European invasion, this concentration also promotes the study of continuity in the history of American art and architecture. These combined viewpoints promote a clearer understanding of art within American art traditions.</p><p>Art of the Modern Age encompasses the history of painting, sculpture, architecture, decorative art, drawing, graphic art, photography and film in Europe and the Americas from 1750 to the present.

In general, the focus of the program is the creation of new works of theatre and dance for stage and classroom, and development of research skills.</p><h4>Required Courses</h4><p>The purpose of the required courses for the Master of Arts degree is to provide a common conceptual framework for all graduate students in the program. The required courses aim to strengthen critical and practical skills that will support and guide students' direction and concentration in the remainder of the program and beyond.</p><table><tbody><tr><td>THEA/DANC 500</td><td>Introduction to Graduate Study</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>THEA/DANC 503</td><td>Performance Theory</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>THEA/DANC 506</td><td>Critical Issues in the Performing Arts</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>THEA/DANC 512</td><td>Graduate Seminar (elective)</td><td>3</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Degree Plans</h3><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Dance concentration in Dance History and Criticism</strong></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Required core: DANC 500 and either DANC 503 or 506</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Dance requirements: 6 hours from DANC 562, 563, 564, 566, or 567<br></td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>DANC 531 Criticism</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Electives related to concentration</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Thesis</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Total</strong></td><td><strong>30</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Theatre concentration in Dramatic Writing or Theatre Education and Outreach</strong></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Plan I (Thesis):</strong></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Required core: THEA 500, 503, 506 and 512</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Electives related to concentration</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>THEA 599 Master's Thesis (minimum hours)</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Total</strong></td><td><strong>30</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Plan II (Essay):</strong></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Required core: THEA 500, 503, 506 and 512</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Electives related to concentration</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>THEA 598 Master's Essay</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Other electives</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Total</strong></td><td><strong>33</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><h4>Plan I – Master’s Thesis</h4><p>This is the traditional M.A. program, and culminates in the writing of a formal Thesis, a work of original research and writing (typically, 60-85 pages) that explores in depth a particular, carefully delimited subject related to the student’s area of study. Plan I is especially recommended for students who intend to eventually pursue a Ph.D. The thesis must be written in the UNM Office of Graduate Studies format.</p><h4>Plan II – Master’s Essay and Creative Project</h4><p>Plan II does not require a Thesis, but does require both a substantial Creative Project (usually, this means directing a full-length performance or project in the department, the schools or community, as well as a Master’s Essay. The Master’s Essay is intended to conform to the standards of a major seminar paper or journal article, including careful organization, clarity of argument, original research with full citation, bibliography, typically 30-50 pages in length. The Master’s Essay may address a topic related to the Creative Project, but this is not absolutely necessary. Plan II also includes a written exam, taken during the student’s final semester in the program.</p><h4>Plan II Master’s Exam</h4><p>The Master’s Exam is conducted by a faculty committee of three. The supervisor of the student’s Master’s Essay normally serves as chairperson of the committee and the other two members are chosen in consultation with the student. The subject matter of the examination questions is taken from the particular program of studies followed by the student. The subject matter of the Master’s Essay must be included in the examination questions. Usually the exam is written; the committee may elect, however, to conduct some portion of the exam orally. The length of the exam is three hours. Each member of the committee conducting the exam submits at least one question.</p><hr><br>",

The Counselor Education application form requires a description of previous&nbsp;college course work, employment history, three references, and a personal statement/letter of intent. The Master’s&nbsp;degree application does not require the GRE. Application deadline is November 1stfor admission in the following&nbsp;Fall semester. Students are admitted for the semester for which they are accepted. Deferring admissions requires&nbsp;entire program faculty approval. Application deadlines are firm. Only those applications that are complete(including all paperwork, fees, transcripts, etc.) will be reviewed. No Exceptions. We recommend you&nbsp;submit both Admissions and Program application materials at least two weeks before the deadline dates to&nbsp;ensure the processing of your application. For questions about the Master’s of Arts in Counseling, pleasecontact the Counselor Education office by calling (505) 277-4535, or emailing divbse@unm.edu.It is your responsibility to ensure that all application materials have been received and are on file in&nbsp;Simpson Hall. You may check on the status of your application by calling or emailing the program&nbsp;office.How your Application is EvaluatedSix criteria are applied in evaluating your application. Applications that address each of these issues receive more&nbsp;consideration.1. Academic Record and PotentialThe Graduate School and the Counselor Education Program seek students who have an undergraduate grade point&nbsp;average (GPA) of 3.0 (B). Students must have a bachelors degree or be in their last semester of their&nbsp;undergraduate program. If your undergraduate grades are not representative of the academic work you are&nbsp;currently capable of, you can indicate that your last two years of undergraduate work are more representative of&nbsp;your academic potential or present grades you achieved as a non-degree graduate student.2. Academic BackgroundWe are seeking students who have 18 credit hours of upper division (300-400 level course) undergraduate and/or&nbsp;graduate course work in the behavioral sciences. Courses that can be used to satisfy this requirement may include,&nbsp;for example, Education, Psychology, Family Studies, Sociology, Anthropology, Nursing, and Social Work,&nbsp;depending on the course content.3. Relevant Work ExperienceWe will assess the quality of your work/volunteer experience and its relevance to your development as a&nbsp;counselor. It is to your advantage to tell us about your work/volunteer training including experiences teaching,&nbsp;working in human service settings, providing counseling services, etc.4. Letters of RecommendationYou &nbsp;MUST &nbsp;submit three letters of recommendation for your application to be considered complete. One&nbsp;recommendation letter must be from a professor and the other two may be either academic or from work&nbsp;supervisors, each of whom can attest to your motivation and potential. Although we provide forms for the referee&nbsp;to complete, many referees prefer to write letters on their own stationary. This is fine but they MUST still&nbsp;complete &nbsp;the numerical ratings on our reference form. Personal or character &nbsp;references from friends, clergy, politicians, or family members are usually not rated as highly as detailed letters from individuals who know about&nbsp;the counseling profession and are in a position to judge your professional and academic potential.5. Personal Statement (3 pages maximum)Please tell us about your goals, your motivation for becoming a counselor, and what you can accomplish by&nbsp;studying at UNM’s Counselor Education Program. Describe personal and professional experiences and&nbsp;characteristics that you believe support your candidacy. We consider your statement a “sample” of what we can&nbsp;expect from you as a student. Preference is given to applicants who present an organized and well written&nbsp;rationale for pursuing graduate studies in Counseling.&nbsp;6. Multi-Cultural CompetenceIn your personal statement describe your understanding or cultural pluralism. Tell us about your experiences or&nbsp;studies of people from cultures, backgrounds, or beliefs different from your own.Interview with the FacultyTypically about half of the applicants (selected from an initial screening based on the aforementioned criteria) are&nbsp;invited to interview with the faculty. This provides us with the opportunity to meet potential students and for you&nbsp;to expand on your qualifications for admission to the Counselor Education Program. These interviews are only&nbsp;done in person.",

Additionally, students are responsible for the payment of certain student fees, including the Health Sciences Center library fee.&nbsp; International students will also be responsible for a one-time UNM Global Education Office fee of $125.00 (subject to change).</p><p>During the first academic year, all students share a one-year core curriculum. Additionally, students complete three separate Research Rotations to get experience and exposure to the various research areas available at the UNM Health Sciences Center.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The funding for PhD students is provided through the end of the first academic year (May 31) by the BSGP. During the first year, students identify a research mentor who will assume the financial responsibility starting June 1 and provide the resources necessary for the student to conduct their dissertation research. Students are funded by their research mentor (advisor), and/or<a href=\"http://hsc.unm.edu/research/brep/traininggrants.shtm\">training grants</a>, and/or the research mentor’s department. Students are responsible for identifying a research mentor prior to end of the first academic year in order to continue to progress in the program. The program provides guidance and a variety of opportunities during the first academic year of the program for students to successfully identify research mentors.</p><p>At the end of the first year, PhD students choose a research advisor, declare an area of specialization, and take and pass a qualifying exam so that they may advance to candidacy. Students also choose a faculty Committee on Studies to help guide them through their thesis/dissertation research. In their third or fourth year, all students must successfully complete a comprehensive examination which is administered by their Committee on Studies.</p><p>The next generation of experimental biomedical scientists must be equipped to work productively and in teams with mathematical, computational and physical scientists and engineers in order to answer critical biological questions in the 21st century.

    "program_description": "The UNM EMS Academy is home to New Mexico’s only Bachelor of Science \nprogram in EMS, and is one of only 13 programs offering a Bachelor’s \ndegree in EMS in the U.S.\n\n<p>Offered through the University of New Mexico School of Medicine, our \nprogram is one of a very few programs administered through an academic \nDepartment of Emergency Medicine. This provides our students exceptional\n opportunities to be mentored by Emergency Medicine faculty and \nresidents, and to participate in the day-to-day activities of a busy \nacademic medical center.</p>\n\n<p>Our curriculum was designed to teach and train paramedic leaders to \nbe better prepared to handle the realities of a new era in prehospital \nmedicine. By the time they leave EMSA, our graduates are excellent \nclinicians, teachers, researchers and leaders. They have the breadth of \nknowledge to think independently, and to push the development of EMS. \nThe program prepares students for advanced study; many of our graduates \ngo on to obtain advanced degrees in education and science, medicine, \nphysician assistant studies and business.</p>\n\n<p>Following the tradition of the UNM School of Medicine, our curriculum\n places emphasis on both the science and the humanity of prehospital \nmedicine, throughout all four years of study. Our curriculum begins with\n general education, including courses in the humanities, the social \nsciences, and the basic sciences. These courses, including work in \nhistory, philosophy, language, and anthropology provide a critical \ngeneral education. Students are then required to undertake advanced \ncoursework in the sciences, which provides a critical framework for \nsubsequent studies in clinical paramedicine. During the first two years \nof the program, students become EMT-Basics, and learn the fundamentals \nof prehospital medicine.</p>\n\n<p>The focal point of the BS in EMS program is the core paramedic \ntraining courses, which are usually undertaken in the third year of the \nprogram. Course content is based on the current Paramedic National \nStandard Curriculum, and the program is fully accredited by the \nCommittee on Accreditation of EMS Programs. These courses are taught by \nnationally recognized faculty, all who have extensive backgrounds in the\n delivery of prehospital care. The courses include classroom and \nlaboratory work, as well as clinical experiences in area hospitals and \nEMS agencies.</p>\n\n<p>During the final year of the program, students undertake advanced \ncoursework in clinical EMS, and in research and education. Students may \ntake advanced coursework offered by the UNM Anderson School of \nManagement, the College of Education, and the College of Arts and \nSciences.</p>",
    "admission_requirements": "The BS program may be started either as an incoming first-year \nstudent at UNM, or as a student transferring with advanced standing from\n a recognized two- or four-year college or university.\n<p>There are separate application processes for admission to the \nUniversity of New Mexico, and to the EMS Academy. An EMS admissions \ncommittee evaluates all prospective students.</p> \nProspective students should contact our academic advisor well in \nadvance of their intended matriculation.  The BS degree program begins \nin the fall semester of each year. The priority deadline for \napplications to UNM is mid-June. For more information, contact our \nacademic advisor Shelly McLaughlin,\n\t\t\n\t<a href=\"mailto:SJMcLaughlin@salud.unm.edu\">SJMcLaughlin@salud.unm.edu </a> or the UNM Admissions Office at: <a href=\"http://admissions.unm.edu/general-information/index.html\">http://admissions.unm.edu/general-information/index.html</a>.",

    "career_opportunities": "<p>Emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and paramedics administer first-aid treatment and life-support care to sick or\ninjured persons in pre-hospital setting. Depending on training level, EMTs administer drugs, orally or by injection, and\nperform intravenous procedures under a physician's direction. In addition to operating equipment such as\nelectrocardiograms (EKGs), external defibrillators and bag-valve mask resuscitators in advanced life-support\nenvironments. EMTs assess the nature and extent of illness or injury to establish and prioritize medical procedures.\nEMTs coordinate with other emergency medical team members and police and fire department personnel and are\nresponsible for communicating with dispatchers and treatment center personnel to provide information about situation,\nto arrange reception of victims, and to receive instructions for further treatment. Working in pairs, EMTs perform\nemergency diagnostic and treatment procedures, such as stomach suction, airway management or heart monitoring,\nduring ambulance transport. Because emergency services function 24 hours a day, EMTs and paramedics have\nirregular working hours.&nbsp;</p><div><p>A high school diploma, usually, is required to enter a formal EMT training program. All 50 States require certification\nfor each of the EMT levels. In most States, and the District of Columbia, registration with National Registry for\nEmergency Medical Technicians (NREMT) is required at some or all levels of certification. Some States administer\ntheir own certification examination or provide the option of taking either the NREMT or State examination. To maintain\ncertification, EMTs and paramedics must recertify, usually every two years. UNM offers a BS in Emergency Medicine\nwith three areas of concentration: Clinical Care, EMS Administration, and EMS Education and Training, in addition to\ntraining programs for the three EMT levels.&nbsp;</p></div>",

Strong ties include graduating from a New Mexico high school in which you attended for at least one year or being financially dependent on a New Mexico resident.</p><p>Consideration is also given to enrolled members of federally recognized American Indian Tribes and Alaska Natives and Villages (AI/AN). It is requested that AI/AN applicants provide their Tribal Affiliation, Certificate of Indian Blood (CIB), Enrollment Number, and/or a written description of their involvement with their tribal community upon invitation to complete the Secondary Application. For more specific information regarding UNM's Residency Policies, visit the Office of the Registrar's page on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://registrar.unm.edu/residency.htm\">Residency Information</a>.</p><p>The university is also a member of the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education (WICHE). Therefore, consideration is given to residents of participating states that at present have no medical schools (Montana and Wyoming). WICHE applicants must apply through the Early Decision Program and must also have at least the average MCAT/GPA as the last year's entering class in order to receive consideration. The 2012 entering class average MCAT composite score was 28 and the average cumulative GPA was 3.6.</p><p>Foreign national applicants must reside in New Mexico for a least one year prior to application in order to fulfill the residency requirement.</p><h3><strong>Clinical Experience</strong></h3><p>The Committee on Admissions carefully reviews each type of clinical experience in which every individual applicant to medical school has participated. The Committee believes that every applicant should reflect a vibrant interest in medicine demonstrated by clinical experiences with direct patient contact and knowledge of New Mexico's health care issues. The intent is to provide the applicant with the opportunity to prove to himself or herself and to the Committee on Admissions that medicine is the profession in which the individual whole-heartedly wishes to study and work. This volunteer or possible work experience may be in a hospital or clinic setting, perhaps in a nursing home or hospice environment. It is up to each student to take initiative to locate their clinical experiences through interactions with the various volunteer offices of the local hospitals or through interactions with their professors, friends, family members, etc. There is a plethora of summer clinical experience programs around the country; however, application to those programs begins during the winter months, long before the summer starts.</p><p>The Committee also examines the type of community volunteer activities in which applicants have been involved. The Committee believes that individuals who have participated in such activities are more likely to relate well to other people, an essential aspect of the physician-patient interaction.&lt;p&gt;The Committee also examines the type of community volunteer activities in which applicants have been involved.</p><p>The Office of Medical Student Affairs recently established a Shadowing Program that provides local New Mexico high school students the opportunity to follow a UNM physician for a period of time. For more information regarding the Shadowing Program please go to the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://hsc.unm.edu/som/oss/Shadowing.shtml\">Shadowing Program</a>&nbsp;website.</p><h3><strong>Tuition and Fees</strong></h3><p>Estimated tuition and fees for the 2010-2011 academic year:</p><ul><li>Resident tuition - $16,170</li><li>Non-resident tuition - $46,347</li><li>Disability Insurance, per year - $103</li><li>Needlestick Insurance, per year - $60</li><li>Curriculum Fee - $2,700</li><li>Diagnostic Equipment (1st year students only) - $640</li><li>Library Fee - $150</li><li>Microscope Fee (1st year students only) - $100</li></ul><strong><p>For more information regarding tuition, please reference the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://finaid.unm.edu/COA-MED_10-11.pdf\">UNM School of Medicine Tuition Form</a>&nbsp;or go to the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://hsc.unm.edu/som/finaid/coa.shtml\">UNM SOM Financial Aid website</a>.</p></strong><h3><strong>Pre-Med Advisement</strong></h3><p>The UNM SOM Office of Admissions offers pre-med advisement to any students interested in applying to medical school. The Office of Admissions holds monthly advisement workshops to provide students with the basic information on applying to medical school.&nbsp;<strong>All students interested in setting up a one-on-one advisement appointment with one of the UNM SOM Office of Admissions staff persons must first attend an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://hsc.unm.edu/som/admissions/AdviseWorkshop.shtml\">advisement workshop</a>.</strong></p><strong></strong><p>UNM Students can also receive pre-med advisement from The University of New Mexico's University College or the College of Arts and Sciences.</p><strong><p><strong>Be very careful of any outside advice you receive from other physicians and/or current medical students as information on the application process may change from year to year.</strong></p></strong>",

    "program_description": "<p>The Bachelor of Arts in Environmental Planning &amp; Design (B.A.E.P.D.) at the University of New Mexico is an undergraduate course of study related to the graduate degree in Community &amp; Regional Planning (CRP). Environmental planning encompasses systematic and creative methods used to influence and respond to dynamic changes occurring in neighborhoods, cities, and entire regions throughout the world. Planners assist communities in formulating policies and plans to meet their social, economic, environmental, cultural, and physical needs.</p><p>In the American Southwest, human strategies for adapting to arid conditions have been evolving for thousands of years. They represent many different cultural perspectives, complex social histories, and rich practical learning that are vital for current and future survival. The Bachelor of Arts in Environmental Planning &amp; Design offers students the opportunity to engage in socially and environmentally relevant skill building and to address the issues of an evolving social and cultural landscape.</p><p>Opportunities for Environmental Planners exist in a variety of governmental, non-profit, and private for-profit settings. Graduates have been hired in tribal, local, state, regional, and national planning and design offices. At the national level, graduates work for the National Park Service, the U.S. Forest Service, the National Resources Conservation Service, the Peace Corps, Los Alamos National Laboratories, the U.S. Department of Transportation, environmental advocacy organizations, and university facility planning departments. Our B.A.E.P.D. graduates may use this degree to advance to a graduate program or to work for state agencies, community-based organizations, community development foundations, or private planning firms concentrating in environmental analysis, geographic information systems, and community health planning.</p><p>Students in the B.A.E.P.D. Program take a total of 128 credits. The course of study consists of 37 credits from the University of New Mexico core courses as a prerequisite to the program, 36 credits of B.A.E.P.D. core courses, 39 credits of Community &amp; Regional Planning Concentration courses, and 16 credits of electives.</p>&nbsp;",

    "program_description": "The Water Resources Program offers a Masters of Water Resources (MWR), an interdisciplinary professional degree, designed to prepare students for careers in water resources management. Entering students have a basic proficiency in at least one water-related discipline, of which economics is included. The program seeks to expand and deepen students' knowledge of their primary disciplines as well as provide them with an integrated perspective on water in nature and society, improve their capacity to think carefully and comprehensively, and develop their technical and communications skills. Economics graduate students may find it advantageous to complete an MWR in conjunction with their economics graduate degree or to take a WRP water-modeling course, which is cross-listed in economics. These avenues are natural extensions for those students choosing to specialize in resource and environmental economics. A number of economics faculty are also WRP faculty. They not only teach in the program but also serve as advisors and committee members for WRP students' professional projects.",
